Patient: Hi, I'm Jane and I live at 12 Second St, Trenton, NJ. I think I may have a UTI. I ate at a new restaurant down the street last night and I think that may have caused it.

Doctor: Hi Jane, thank you for coming in. UTIs are often caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract, so it's possible that the food you ate could have been a contributing factor. Let's run some tests to confirm the infection and determine the best course of treatment.
