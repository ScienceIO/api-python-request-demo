Sample 1: Telemed Provider & UTI Patient
Telemedicine provider: Hi there, this is Jane Hu, your telemedicine provider. I understand you're experiencing symptoms of a UTI. Can you confirm your name and tell me more about what you're feeling?

Patient: Yeah, my name is Rachel Doe. I've been having a lot of pain when I pee and it burns. I've also been having to go to the bathroom a lot more frequently than normal. My date of birth is January 1, 2000 and I'm a female. My insurance provider is XYZ Health and my policy number is 123025015023934.

Telemedicine provider: That sounds like a classic case of a UTI. Based on your medical history, which includes a previous UTI in 2018 and a history of diabetes, I would recommend that you start taking a round of antibiotics to help clear up the infection. Have you ever taken antibiotics before?
